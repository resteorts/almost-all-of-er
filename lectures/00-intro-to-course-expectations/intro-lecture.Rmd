## What is Entity Resolution?

Entity resolution (record linkage or de-duplication) is method used to remove duplicate entries from large, noisy databases that often do not have a unique identifer. 

Can you think of some examples that you have seen?

## Unstable/slow internet?

Go to [https://github.com/resteorts/almost-all-of-er/](https://github.com/resteorts/almost-all-of-er) and fork the repository. 

- The videos are compressed, and this was done on purpose for those in the class that might have slow internet. I would suggest that everyone forks the repository to avoid any issues. 

- Verify that you can play them (otherwise install something on your machine). 

- Make sure to pull the repository each day. I update the repository very often as all the course resources are here (homeworks, lectures, data, videos). If you don't pull often, you might run into some issues!

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

<font class="vocab">Lecture</font> 
- Learn entity resolution methods 
- Lectures will consist of learning methodology and applied coding techniques
- Lectures will be full of interactive exercises so make sure that you laptop is charged and your ready to do some computing! 
- You might find it useful to have a tablet/document camera for taking notes 
- An alternative to this is using your phone to take pictures using Evernote (students have said this worked well in the spring/fall). Please test things out in advance and make sure things are legible!

## Activities & Assessments

- <font class="vocab"> Homework </font>: Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills. *Lowest score dropped.*

- <font class="vocab"> Quizzes </font>: Quizzes that will assess your knowledge of the course. *Lowest score dropped.*

- <font class="vocab">Class/Lab</font>: **You will be responsible for keeping up with all class and lab material on a weekly basis (even though there are recordings)!**

---


## Class Engagement

0. Students are expected to have read the assigned reading before coming to class. 
1. Students are expected to have watched the pre-recorded videos (if available). 
2. Prof. Steorts will go through the concepts in class again, highlighting the most important parts, providing clarifications, solutions/advice, and more advanced insights. 
3. Prof. Steorts will provide exercises for the class to work through, an interactive environment, and discussions. 
4. TAs will be present to help in these activities such that we can break into small groups and students can receive more individualized attention. 
5. Please ask questions during class and being active as this will enhance the experience for everyone! 


---

## Homeworks

1. All code must be written to be reproducible in Markdown. 
2. All derivations can be done in any format of your choosing (word, latex, markdown, written by hand) but must be converted to a pdf document. It must be legible.
3. All files must be zipped together and submitted to Sakai as one file (including Rmd and pdf). Your pdf document must be uploaded to Duke GradeScope. Please make sure to upload early to avoid issues. 
4. Ask questions early if you have a problem to a TA regarding submission issues. 
5. Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. 

Remark: Sakai is for reproducible code. Gradescope is to make grading easier for everyone. Unfortunately, there is not a platform that handles both.  

**Please see the syllabus for all homework guidelines.**

---

## Why Sakai + Gradescope?

1. Sakai will be used for reproducibility so this can be checked. 

2. Gradescope will be used to:

-  return homework/exams more promptly
- ensure  complete  fairness
- allow  students  to  continue  to  learn  from  homeworks  by  reworking problems  without  the  right  answer  written  out  to  the  side

---

## Quizzes

The format of quizzes will be announced in class and I will go over these will the entire class so that everyone can ask questions. 

The goal of having quizzes is make sure that your baseline knowledge of entity resolution is solid before we move onto more advanced topics. 

The goal of the quizzes is NOT to be stressful or overwhelming, but instead a positive, learning experience. 

---

## Grade Calculation

<small>

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 40%|
| Quiz 1 | 13.33% |
| Quiz 2 | 13.33% |
| Quiz 3 | 13.33% |
| Final Project | 20% |

--

- See the syllabus for grade breakdowns. 
- Grades will **never** be curved down. 
- You are expected to attend lectures and labs in order to keep up with the course material. - There will be no attendance grade or participation grade, but it's very important to attend class given that this is a small class! 


</small>

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean’s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp; Regrade Requests

- No late homeworks will be accepted, so please do not ask.  
    
- No make up exams will be given.  

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment was returned. 

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.
Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- **Google group**: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Google since there are likely other students with the same questions.

---

## Academic Resource Center

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.

## Technology/Other

- Make sure that you have your zoom ids organized so that you're not late for class. 
- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.
- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.
- If you have a question, I don't mind if you interupt me during class. 
- If you find a **typo in the slides**, please write these down and email these to myself and Olivier so they can be fixed. 

---

## Accessibility 

Please contact the [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu) if there is an element of the course that is not accessible to you. There you can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations.
